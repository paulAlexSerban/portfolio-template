# Storybook Best Practices
## 1. One Storybook File Per Component
The story file should have:

- one Default story
- a Playground story
- and other stories that reflect a specific state or API of the component.

The default story displays the component with only its required props defined. This creates a visual baseline representation for everyone. So, when people think about a specific component, ideally they will remember what’s reproduced by the default story.

The playground story is used to help consumers of the component to try different combinations of props and see how the component responds.

Stories should reflect a specific state or API of the component. For example, if we have a button component that has a type props that accepts the values primary, secondary, tertiary, or error. Then, we would have four stories: `Button/Primary`, `Button/Secondary`, `Button/Tertiary`, and `Button/Error`

There are a few reasons to follow this pattern:

- It is easier to share a link of a component that precisely defines a state that you want to reference, which is useful when communicating with QA and designers.
- If Storybook is combined with testing tools, like snapshot testing or visual regression testing, each story becomes a unit testing. If one of them fails, you know exactly which one.
- By making the stories explicit we avoid hiding components states under the knobs.

## 2. Naming Convention
Name the storybook files `[ComponentName].stories.[js|jsx|tsx]`. The important thing is that you and your team agree on a naming convention and everyone follows it. Include the name of the component in the file name because it makes it easier to find in the code editor. Otherwise, you could end up with five files called `index.stories.tsx` and then you’d have to open each one or perform a search to find the right one.

## 3. New Components Must Have a Storybook
It helps to create a library of components and gain the benefits of having one. If your team has some kind of a PR checklist, Storybook could be one of the items to check before merging the code into master.

## 4. Prefer the Component Story Format
[Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) or CSF is the recommended way to write stories according to the Storybook maintainers. It’s basically a set of conventions to be used in the story files. Instead of using the storiesOf API, you write regular JavaScript functions and export them. Storybook converts the named and the default exports to stories. One big advantage of the CSF format is that the code looks cleaner and is easier to read. Instead of the Storybook boilerplate, you can focus on what your code is actually doing

## 5. Keep Data Under Control
If you notice that you need the same data in many different stories, it may be a good idea to create a mocks folder and add JavaScript files that export factory functions that will create reusable data. Let us suppose that we have an avatar component that displays the user image, name, anchor and this component is used in multiple places. We could have a file named mocks/user.js which has something like this:

```javascript
const getUser = (overrides = {}) => {
    const defaultValues = {
        username: "Some User",
        anchor: "@someuser",
        image: "https://webapp/static/images/someuser.png"
    };
    return Object.assign(defaultValues, overrides);
};
export default getUser;
```
Why the factory functions? Just to make sure we are getting a new object every time. If we imported an object we could accidentally modify it and cause wrong results. I have seen it. Also, here I’m using Object.assign as an example, but you may need something more sophisticated that handles the merging of arrays and objects. Lodash and RamdaJS have functions for that
