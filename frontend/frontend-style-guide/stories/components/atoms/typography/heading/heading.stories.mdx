# Heading

## Using Headings
- Headings are much more than a big bold title, they provide a solid structure to the webpage. Think of headings as an outline of your webpage.
- The structure should be portrayed both in a visual and technical manner, so people can see the structure, and screen readers are able to identity the structure in order to read it out.
- Users who can see the page decide within seconds whether or not the content is relevant to them by skimming through headings, glancing over sub-headings keeping an eye out for significant keywords. Breaking up content with headings allows the page to be easily scanned by the user
- Without a heading structure, you force users to do extra work to find the information they’re looking for, who has the time and luxury?
- From an accessibility point of view the structure in the code should align with the visual presentation and make sense as a “table of contents” for the page.
- Use headings to introduce content, they are labels not statements.

### Sections and sub-sections
- In total, there are six levels of headings you can use to structure sections of content on the page (`<h1>` through to `<h6>`).
- Heading 1 is the most important and is the heading for the page, this typically corresponds to the title of the page. It gives users an indication of what the page is about - you should have a single Heading 1 on each page.
- Each heading 2 creates a section of content. They divide pages into consumable sections which help to organize the content.
