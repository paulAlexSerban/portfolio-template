# Badge
- Badge (aka Tag) — small overlapped UI item which indicates a status, notification, or event that appears in relativity with the underlying object.
- Badges are labels which hold small amounts of information.

## Types
The default content of Badge's body is
- **Numeric value** — to display the number of events - used to represent the number of events related to the parent UI item
<Canvas withToolbar withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-atoms-badge--pill" />
</Canvas>

- **Text** caption — to tag, name or categorize items
  - specify a label for the variety of objects (e.g. to tag a topic, categorize items, or indicate views amount)
- **Icon** — to show up the status of the underlying object
  - show up the condition of a related component, or response to a user with the feedback
- **No item (dot-only Badge)** — to inform without details
  - used in order to just attract your attention to the specific control and encourage you to explore what is inside

## Styles & Themes
For a deep themification in order to set Badge more distinct, you have to apply several properties:

- **Colors** — to regulate the Badge priority
- **Corner** radius — to set a Badge's container shape
- **Outline** stroke — to visually separate Badge from underlying item
- **Shadow** — to set a style with hovering effect
