# Grid

## Under the hood
- built with Flexbox and closely mirrors Bootstrap's grid in that it uses containers, rows and columns to layout and align content

## Basic grid
```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col">1 of 4</div>
    <div class="col">2 of 4</div>
    <div class="col">3 of 4</div>
    <div class="col">4 of 4</div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Container
- `grid` defines the overall grid context at the top level and applies the proper margin and the default max-width
- you can also remove this max width, by using the grid modifier class `grid--full-width`

Rows
- `row` defines a row of items inside the grid — think of rows as wrappers for columns
- each column has horizontal padding (aka a gutter) that defines the space between them
- you can negate this padding at the row level with negative margins, allowing the content within your columns to be aligned along the left side

Columns
- `col` defines individual columns inside a row. Use as many columns as you'd like out of the possible 12 or 16 per row. 
- with Flexbox columns widths are set in percentages relative to their parent element so columns without a specified d width will automatically be equal. For example, four instances of `col` will will give you four equal width columns — each 25% of the parent from the small breakpoint on up


## Grid modes
- the default gutter width is 32px because type, within or without containers, never has less than a 32px gutter. 
- for containers and components, however, there are three different gutter structures: Wide (default), Narrow and Condensed. 
- these three gutter scenarios enable typographic alignment by allowing containers and certain components to “hang” into the gutter.
